### 2. Azure TTS Priority Fix

**Problem:** Application was using browser TTS by default for most languages, only using Azure for specific "rare" languages like Estonian.

**Solution:** Changed TTS priority to **ALWAYS** try Azure TTS first for ALL languages.

**File Updated:**
- ✅ `client/src/services/enhancedTtsService.ts`

**Before:**
```typescript
// Only used Azure for specific languages
const cloudTtsLanguages = ['et', 'lv', 'lt', 'fi', 'no', 'da', 'is', 'ga'];
if (shouldUseCloudTts) {
  return this.speakWithCloudTTS(text, options);
} else {
  return this.speakWithBrowserTTS(text, options); // Most languages used this!
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
// ALWAYS try Azure TTS first for ALL languages
console.log(`☁️ Using Azure TTS for ${options.language || 'default'} (realistic, human-like voice)`);
return this.speakWithCloudTTS(text, options);

// Browser TTS is used automatically as fallback if Azure fails
```

**How It Works Now:**

1. **Primary**: Azure Neural TTS for ALL languages (realistic, human-like) ✨
2. **Fallback**: Browser TTS (only if Azure fails or not configured) 🔄

**Languages Now Using Azure by Default:**
- 🇺🇸 English (all variants)
- 🇪🇪 Estonian
- 🇪🇸 Spanish
- 🇷🇺 Russian
- 🇩🇪 German
- 🇫🇷 French
- 🇮🇹 Italian
- 🇵🇹 Portuguese
- 🇳🇱 Dutch
- 🇸🇪 Swedish
- 🇳🇴 Norwegian
- 🇩🇰 Danish
- 🇫🇮 Finnish
- 🇱🇻 Latvian
- 🇱🇹 Lithuanian
- 🇵🇱 Polish
- **...and all other supported languages!**

### 3. Benefits of This Change

**Before:**
- ❌ Only Estonian and rare languages used Azure
- ❌ English, Spanish, Russian, etc. used robotic browser TTS
- ❌ Inconsistent voice quality
- ❌ Most users heard robotic voices

**After:**
- ✅ **ALL languages use Azure Neural TTS first**
- ✅ Consistent, professional voice quality
- ✅ Human-like speech for everyone
- ✅ Better user experience across all languages
- ✅ Graceful fallback if Azure not configured

### 4. How to Verify

**Check Console Logs:**

**✅ Azure TTS Working (What you should see):**
```
🎙️ Speaking with enhanced TTS: "Hello, how can I help you?"
☁️ Using Azure TTS for en-US (realistic, human-like voice)
🎙️ Using Azure TTS for realistic speech...
✅ Microsoft Azure TTS: Generated speech for en using en-US-JennyNeural
✅ Playing Azure TTS audio for: en-US
```

**⚠️ Fallback to Browser TTS (If Azure not configured):**
```
🎙️ Speaking with enhanced TTS: "Hello, how can I help you?"
☁️ Using Azure TTS for en-US (realistic, human-like voice)
⚠️ Azure Speech Key not configured. Using Google Translate fallback.
⚠️ Falling back to browser TTS
```

### 6. What You Need to Do

**To get Azure TTS working:**

1. **Add Azure credentials to your environment:**
   ```env
   AZURE_SPEECH_KEY=your-key-here
   AZURE_SPEECH_REGION=westeurope
   ```

2. **Restart your server:**
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm start
   ```

3. **Test it:**
   - Start any conversation in any language
   - Check console logs
   - Listen to the voice quality

**Expected Result:**
- Natural, human-like voices for all languages
- Professional quality speech
- Much better than robotic browser TTS

### 7. Notes for Production

**Environment Variables Required:**
- `AZURE_SPEECH_KEY` - Your Azure Speech Service key
- `AZURE_SPEECH_REGION` - Your Azure region (e.g., `westeurope`)

**If Not Configured:**
- Application will still work
- Will use browser TTS as fallback
- Users will hear robotic voices instead of Azure's realistic ones

**Recommendation:**
- **Always configure Azure in production** for best user experience
- Use free tier (5M characters/month) - more than enough
- Cost-effective even on paid tier ($16/1M characters)
