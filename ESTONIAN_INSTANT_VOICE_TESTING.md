## 🧪 **How to Test (Step by Step):**

### **Step 1: Restart Your Server**
```bash
# Stop current server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart:
cd server
npm start
```

### **Step 2: Refresh Your Browser**
- Hard refresh: `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac)
- Clear cache if needed

### **Step 3: Test Estonian Voice**

1. **Go to Conversations page**
2. **Click "New Chat"** button
3. **Scroll down to "Voice Selection"**
4. **Select "🇪🇪 Estonian"** from dropdown

**You should see:**
```
☁️ Cloud Voice Enabled for ET
✅ This language uses cloud-based text-to-speech. 
   No downloads required! The voice will work 
   instantly for all users.
```

5. **Click "Test Voice" button**

---

## 🎙️ **What Should Happen:**

### **In Browser Console:**
```
🎤 Testing voice for language: et-EE
☁️ Using cloud TTS for et (no downloads needed)
🎙️ Playing cloud TTS audio for: et-EE
✅ Cloud TTS speech completed
✅ Voice test completed for et-EE
```

### **What You'll Hear:**
- Estonian voice saying "Hello, this is a test of the selected voice"
- Clear, natural pronunciation
- No robot sound
- **Works instantly - no waiting, no downloads!**

---

## 🔍 **Troubleshooting:**

### **If you see errors in console:**

1. **Check server is running:**
   - Server should show: `Server running on port 5002`

2. **Check cloud TTS route is loaded:**
   - Look for: `✅ Routes registered successfully`

3. **Check network tab:**
   - Should see request to `/api/cloud-tts/speak`
   - Response should be `audio/mpeg`

### **If audio doesn't play:**

1. **Check browser console for errors**
2. **Make sure sound isn't muted**
3. **Try in incognito/private mode**
4. **Try different browser (Chrome recommended)**

### **If still using browser voice (wrong):**

Check console - should say:
```
☁️ Using cloud TTS for et (no downloads needed)
```

If it says something else, the cloud TTS might not be triggering. Check:
- Server restart complete?
- Browser cache cleared?
- Correct Estonian language code (`et-EE`)?
