## 🧪 How to Test

### Step 1: Wait for Deployment
Railway should automatically deploy the new version. Check your Railway dashboard or wait 2-3 minutes.

### Step 2: Open Browser Console
**This is crucial!** Open your browser's developer console:
- **Chrome/Edge:** Press `F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+I`
- **Firefox:** Press `F12`
- **Safari:** Press `Cmd+Option+I`

### Step 3: Start a Voice Call
1. Go to https://salesbuddy.pro (or your domain)
2. Log in
3. Click "Start New Conversation"
4. Select **"Voice Call"** mode (📞)
5. Configure your client settings
6. **Important:** Select a voice (not random)
7. Click "Start Call"

### Step 4: Send a Message
Either:
- Speak into your microphone, OR
- Type a message and click send

### Step 5: Watch the Console
You should see a sequence of logs like this:

```
🔧 [SPEECH-INPUT] Callback registration effect triggered
✅ [SPEECH-INPUT] ========== TTS CALLBACK REGISTERED ==========
🎙️ Speaking AI response in call mode
🎙️ [SPEECH-INPUT] ========== AI RESPONSE SPEAKING ==========
🎙️ [ENHANCED-TTS] ========== CLOUD TTS REQUEST ==========
📡 [ENHANCED-TTS] Response status: 200
🎵 [ENHANCED-TTS] Audio received, creating Audio element...
🎬 [ENHANCED-TTS] Attempting to play audio...
✅ [ENHANCED-TTS] Audio play() successful
▶️ [ENHANCED-TTS] Audio playback started
✅ [ENHANCED-TTS] Audio playback completed
```

### Step 6: Report Back
**Copy ALL the console logs** and send them to me. This will tell me exactly what's happening!

## 🔍 What to Look For

### ✅ Good Signs:
- `✅ [SPEECH-INPUT] TTS CALLBACK REGISTERED` - Callback is set up
- `📡 [ENHANCED-TTS] Response status: 200` - Server responded
- `📦 [ENHANCED-TTS] Audio blob size: XXXX bytes` - Audio received
- `✅ [ENHANCED-TTS] Audio play() successful` - Playing!

### ❌ Bad Signs:
- `⚠️ Not speaking AI response` - Callback not triggered
- `🔐 [ENHANCED-TTS] Token: ❌ Missing` - Authentication issue
- `📡 [ENHANCED-TTS] Response status: 401/500` - Server error
- `❌ [ENHANCED-TTS] Audio play() failed` - Browser blocking audio
- `🚫 [ENHANCED-TTS] AUTOPLAY BLOCKED` - Browser autoplay policy

## 🚫 Common Issues & Quick Fixes

### Issue: Autoplay Blocked
**Symptoms:** 
```
❌ [ENHANCED-TTS] Audio play() failed: NotAllowedError
🚫 [ENHANCED-TTS] AUTOPLAY BLOCKED
```

**Fix:**
1. Click anywhere on the page before starting the call
2. Try sending a second message (first one might be blocked)
3. Check browser settings - allow audio for your site
4. Try Chrome/Edge (best autoplay support)

---

### Issue: No Audio Received
**Symptoms:**
```
📦 [ENHANCED-TTS] Audio blob size: 0 bytes
```

**Fix:**
- Azure TTS might not be configured on server
- Check server logs for Azure errors
- Will automatically fall back to browser TTS

---

### Issue: Token Missing
**Symptoms:**
```
🔐 [ENHANCED-TTS] Token: ❌ Missing
```

**Fix:**
1. Log out and log back in
2. Clear browser cache and cookies
3. Check that you're logged in properly

## 📊 Debugging Checklist

Before testing:
- [ ] Deployment completed (check Railway dashboard)
- [ ] Browser console is open (F12)
- [ ] System volume is turned up
- [ ] Headphones/speakers connected
- [ ] No ad blockers or privacy extensions active
- [ ] Using Chrome, Edge, or Firefox (not Safari)

During test:
- [ ] Selected "Voice Call" mode (not chat)
- [ ] Selected a specific voice (not "Random")
- [ ] Sent a message
- [ ] Watched console for logs
- [ ] Checked browser volume (not muted)

After test:
- [ ] Copied ALL console logs
- [ ] Noted what you heard (or didn't hear)
- [ ] Checked if fallback browser TTS was used

## 📤 What to Send Me

Please send:

1. **ALL console logs** from the moment you started the call until the AI finished speaking (or failed)

2. **What you observed:**
   - Did you hear any audio at all?
   - Did you see "Playing Azure TTS" or "Falling back to browser TTS"?
   - Did it work on the 2nd message but not the 1st?

3. **Your browser:**
   - Which browser? (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, etc.)
   - Version number if possible

4. **Your device:**
   - Desktop or mobile?
   - Operating system?

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Deploy and wait** (2-3 minutes for Railway to deploy)
2. **Test with console open** (this is the most important part!)
3. **Copy all the logs** (don't just screenshot, copy the text)
4. **Send me the logs** so I can see exactly what's happening

The enhanced logging will tell us **exactly** where the issue is! 🚀

---

## 💡 Important Notes

- The first message might be blocked by browser autoplay policy - this is normal
- Subsequent messages should work fine
- If Azure TTS fails, it will automatically fall back to browser TTS
- The system is designed to be resilient - it should always try to speak

---

## 🔧 If All Else Fails

If you still can't hear anything after following all steps:

1. Try a different browser
2. Try a different device
3. Check if browser TTS works: Go to Settings → Voice Selection → Test Voice
4. Send me the console logs - they will tell us what's blocking it!
