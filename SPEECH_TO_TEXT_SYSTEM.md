   - Say "Send message" or click the send button
   - Messages are automatically enhanced with punctuation and formatting

### For Developers

1. **Adding New Languages**:
   ```typescript
   // Add language code to supported languages
   const languageMap = {
     'en': 'en-US',
     'es': 'es-ES',
     'ru': 'ru-RU',
     'et': 'et-EE'
   };
   ```

2. **Custom Voice Commands**:
   ```typescript
   // Add commands to VoiceCommands component
   const newCommand = {
     phrase: 'your command',
     action: 'action_name',
     description: 'Command description'
   };
   ```

3. **Enhancement Options**:
   ```typescript
