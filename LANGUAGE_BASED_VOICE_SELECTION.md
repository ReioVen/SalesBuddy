# 🎯 Language-Based Voice Selection System

## ✅ **COMPLETELY REWORKED: Language-First Voice Selection**

### **🎯 What's New:**

1. **✅ Language Names Only** - Shows "Estonian", "English", "Russian" instead of individual voices
2. **✅ Automatic Random Selection** - System picks random voice from selected language
3. **✅ Clean Interface** - No more cluttered voice lists
4. **✅ Smart Grouping** - Languages grouped by supported languages only

## 🌍 **Voice Selection Interface:**

### **🎯 Dropdown Options:**
```
🎲 Random Voice (Auto-select)
🇪🇪 Estonian
🇺🇸 English  
🇷🇺 Russian
🇪🇸 Spanish
🇩🇪 German
🇫🇷 French
🇮🇹 Italian
🇵🇹 Portuguese
🇳🇱 Dutch
🇵🇱 Polish
```

### **🎲 How It Works:**
1. **User selects language** (e.g., "🇪🇪 Estonian")
2. **System automatically picks random voice** from that language
3. **Each conversation gets different voice** for variety
4. **No manual voice selection needed**

## 🎯 **Technical Implementation:**

### **1. Language Selection Handler:**
```javascript
onChange={(e) => {
  const selectedLanguageName = e.target.value;
  const selectedLang = supportedLanguages.find(lang => 
    selectedLanguageName.includes(lang.name)
  );
  
  if (selectedLang) {
    // Get random voice for the selected language
    const randomVoice = universalTtsService.getRandomVoiceForLanguage(selectedLang.code);
    // Set the random voice automatically
  }
}}
```

### **2. Random Voice Selection:**
```javascript
getRandomVoiceForLanguage(languageCode: string): UniversalTtsVoice | null {
  const voicesForLang = this.getVoicesForLanguage(languageCode);
  if (voicesForLang.length === 0) return null;
  
  const randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * voicesForLang.length);
  return voicesForLang[randomIndex];
}
```

### **3. Language Options:**
```javascript
const supportedLanguages = [
  { code: 'et', name: 'Estonian', flag: '🇪🇪' },
  { code: 'en', name: 'English', flag: '🇺🇸' },
  { code: 'ru', name: 'Russian', flag: '🇷🇺' },
  // ... more languages
];
```
