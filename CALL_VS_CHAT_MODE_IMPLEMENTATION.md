# Call vs Chat Mode Implementation

## Overview
We've successfully implemented a separate **Call Mode** and **Chat Mode** system in SalesBuddy. This allows users to choose between text-based chat conversations and voice-based call conversations, with automatic hands-free mode for calls.

## What's New

### 1. **Two Distinct Modes**
- **Chat Mode** (ðŸ’¬): Traditional text-based conversations with optional voice input
- **Call Mode** (ðŸ“ž): Voice-first conversations with automatic hands-free mode

### 2. **Main Features**

#### Chat Mode
- Text-based conversation interface
- Optional voice input via microphone button
- Manual control over speech recognition
- Standard blue color scheme

#### Call Mode
- **Automatic hands-free mode** - No need to manually enable it
- **Auto-start speech recognition** - Microphone automatically activates
- **Voice-first experience** - Optimized for speaking naturally
- **Visual indicators** - Green color scheme with "LIVE" badge
- **Seamless voice flow** - AI speaks responses, then automatically listens for your reply

### 3. **UI Changes**

#### Home Screen (`/conversations`)
- **"Start Chat"** button (Blue) - Opens chat mode conversation
- **"Start Call"** button (Green) - Opens call mode conversation
- Both buttons are clearly labeled and color-coded

#### Conversation Setup Modal
- Shows mode-specific header:
  - Chat Mode: "Start New Conversation" with ðŸ’¬ Text Chat badge
  - Call Mode: "Start New Call" with ðŸ“ž Voice Call badge
- Call mode shows helpful info box explaining automatic hands-free activation
- Submit button adapts to mode (green for calls, blue for chats)

#### Active Conversation Window
- **Mode indicator** in header:
  - Call mode: Green phone icon with "ðŸ“ž Call with [Client]" and "LIVE" badge
  - Chat mode: Blue user icon with "Chat with [Client]"
- Clear visual distinction between modes

### 4. **Technical Improvements**

#### Optimized TTS Initialization
- **Lazy loading**: TTS only initializes when needed, not on page load
- **Background initialization**: Services load in the background without blocking UI
- **Faster startup**: Removed blocking initialization that caused delays
- **Smart caching**: Once initialized, TTS services are reused

#### Backend Support
- New `conversationMode` field in Conversation model
- Backend validates and stores mode ('chat' or 'call')
- Mode is preserved throughout conversation lifecycle

#### Hands-Free Mode Enhancements
- Automatic activation for call mode
- Improved speech recognition restart logic
- Better timing for TTS completion detection
- Smoother transitions between speaking and listening

## How to Use

### Starting a Chat
1. Click "Start Chat" button (blue)
2. Configure client settings
3. Click "ðŸ’¬ Start Chat"
4. Type or optionally use voice input

### Starting a Call
1. Click "Start Call" button (green)
2. Configure client settings
3. Click "ðŸ“ž Start Call"
4. **Hands-free mode activates automatically**
5. Start speaking naturally - no need to click microphone
6. AI responds with voice and automatically listens for your reply

## Benefits

### For Users
- **Clearer workflow**: Know exactly what mode you're in
- **Faster setup**: Call mode auto-configures hands-free settings
- **Better experience**: No more fumbling with checkboxes and settings
- **More natural**: Calls feel like real phone conversations

### For Performance
- **Faster load times**: TTS initializes only when needed
- **Reduced delays**: Background initialization doesn't block UI
- **Better responsiveness**: Optimized for quick interactions

## Files Modified

### Frontend
- `client/src/pages/Conversations.tsx` - Main UI changes for mode selection and indicators
- `client/src/hooks/useUniversalTextToSpeech.ts` - Optimized TTS initialization
- `client/src/components/SpeechInput.tsx` - Already had hands-free support (no changes needed)

### Backend
- `server/routes/ai.js` - Added conversationMode parameter support
- `server/models/Conversation.js` - Added conversationMode field to schema

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test Chat Mode**:
   - Start a chat, verify text input works
   - Try optional voice input button
   - Confirm normal flow without auto-activation

2. **Test Call Mode**:
   - Start a call, verify hands-free activates automatically
   - Speak and confirm speech recognition works
   - Verify AI responds with voice
   - Check that mic automatically reactivates after AI speaks
   - Test the "LIVE" indicator displays

3. **Test TTS Performance**:
   - Measure page load time (should be faster)
   - Start first conversation (TTS should initialize smoothly)
   - Verify voices work correctly in both Estonian and English

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

- Add call timer display
- Add call recording feature
- Add "Mute" button for calls
- Show conversation mode in history list
- Filter conversations by mode
- Add keyboard shortcuts for call mode

## Known Issues / Notes

- TTS initialization is now lazy-loaded, so first voice interaction may have slight delay (< 500ms)
- Hands-free mode in call mode cannot be manually disabled (by design)
- Call mode always enables speech and voice commands automatically
