# TTS 405 Error Fix

## Issue

Getting a **405 Method Not Allowed** error when trying to use Azure TTS:

```
api/cloud-tts/speak:1 Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 405
‚ùå Azure TTS error: Error: Cloud TTS request failed: 405
‚ö†Ô∏è Falling back to browser TTS
```

## Root Cause

The 405 error typically occurs due to:
1. **CORS Preflight Issue**: The OPTIONS request is not being handled properly
2. **Route Registration Issue**: The route might not be registered correctly
3. **Authentication Token Issue**: The token might not be sent or verified correctly

## Solution Applied

### 1. Added Debug Logging
- Added comprehensive logging to track requests
- Logs when TTS requests are received
- Shows what language and text length is being processed

### 2. Added CORS OPTIONS Handler
- Explicitly handle OPTIONS preflight requests
- Ensures CORS works properly for cross-origin requests

### 3. Enhanced Error Messages
- Better error logging with stack traces
- Clearer indication of Azure vs fallback TTS
- Helps identify exactly where failures occur

## How to Test

### Step 1: Restart Your Server
```bash
cd server
npm start
```

### Step 2: Check Server Logs
You should see these logs when the route is registered:
```
‚úÖ [ROUTES] cloudTts routes registered at /api/cloud-tts
```

### Step 3: Test Voice in Application
1. Go to conversation page
2. Click "Test Voice" button
3. Check browser console and server logs

### Step 4: Look for These Logs

**‚úÖ Success (Azure working):**
```
üéôÔ∏è [CLOUD-TTS] Received speech request
üéôÔ∏è [CLOUD-TTS] Request body: {"text":"Hello..."}
üéôÔ∏è [CLOUD-TTS] Processing TTS for language: et-EE, text length: 45
‚úÖ [CLOUD-TTS] Microsoft Azure TTS: Generated speech for et using et-EE-AnuNeural
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è CORS Preflight:**
```
‚úÖ [CLOUD-TTS] CORS preflight request received
```

**‚ùå Error:**
```
‚ùå [CLOUD-TTS] Cloud TTS error: [error details]
‚ùå [CLOUD-TTS] Error stack: [stack trace]
```

## Additional Checks

### Check 1: Verify Route is Registered
Look for this in server startup logs:
```
app.use('/api/cloud-tts', cloudTtsRoutes);
```

### Check 2: Verify Authentication Token
Check browser DevTools ‚Üí Network ‚Üí Request Headers:
```
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
```

### Check 3: Verify Request Method
In Network tab, the request should show:
- Method: `POST`
- URL: `/api/cloud-tts/speak`
- Content-Type: `application/json`

### Check 4: Check CORS Headers
Response should include:
```
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://localhost:3000
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS
```

## Possible Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "405 Method Not Allowed"
**Cause**: CORS preflight failing or route not found

**Solution**:
1. Verify server is running latest code
2. Check CORS configuration includes your origin
3. Verify OPTIONS handler is working (check logs)

### Issue 2: "401 Unauthorized"
**Cause**: Authentication token missing or invalid

**Solution**:
1. Check user is logged in
2. Verify token is in localStorage: `localStorage.getItem('token')`
3. Check token is being sent in Authorization header

### Issue 3: "404 Not Found"
**Cause**: Route not registered or wrong URL

**Solution**:
1. Verify route is registered: `app.use('/api/cloud-tts', cloudTtsRoutes);`
2. Check API endpoint in frontend: `private apiEndpoint = '/api/cloud-tts/speak';`
3. Restart server to ensure routes are loaded

### Issue 4: Still Getting 405
**Workaround**: Test the API directly with curl:

```bash
# Get your auth token from browser localStorage
TOKEN="your-token-here"

# Test the endpoint
curl -X POST http://localhost:5002/api/cloud-tts/speak \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "text": "Hello, this is a test",
    "language": "en-US",
    "rate": 0.92,
    "pitch": 0.98,
    "volume": 0.85
  }' \
  --output test-audio.mp3
```

If this works, the issue is in the frontend request.
If this fails, the issue is in the backend route.

## Environment Variables Check

Make sure Azure keys are set:

```env
AZURE_SPEECH_KEY_1=your-key-here
AZURE_SPEECH_KEY_2=your-backup-key-here
AZURE_SPEECH_REGION=westeurope
AZURE_ENDPOINT=https://westeurope.api.cognitive.microsoft.com
```

**Verify they're loaded:**
```javascript
// In server/routes/cloudTts.js, check the logs:
console.log('Azure Key 1:', process.env.AZURE_SPEECH_KEY_1 ? 'SET' : 'NOT SET');
console.log('Azure Key 2:', process.env.AZURE_SPEECH_KEY_2 ? 'SET' : 'NOT SET');
console.log('Azure Region:', process.env.AZURE_SPEECH_REGION || 'NOT SET');
console.log('Azure Endpoint:', process.env.AZURE_ENDPOINT || 'NOT SET');
```

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Update server code (already done)
2. ‚úÖ Restart server
3. ‚úÖ Test voice in application
4. ‚úÖ Check server logs for detailed error messages
5. ‚úÖ If still failing, test with curl command above

## Expected Behavior After Fix

1. Voice test triggers POST request to `/api/cloud-tts/speak`
2. Server logs show: `üéôÔ∏è [CLOUD-TTS] Received speech request`
3. Azure TTS generates audio
4. Audio is returned to client
5. Browser plays realistic, human-like voice

## Status

- ‚úÖ Added debug logging
- ‚úÖ Added OPTIONS handler for CORS
- ‚úÖ Enhanced error messages
- ‚è≥ Waiting for server restart and testing

---

**Next**: Restart your server and test the voice. Check logs for the new debug messages!
